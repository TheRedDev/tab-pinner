Simple Chrome extension to pin tabs in Chrome from the keyboard.

Dead simple, no fluff extension.

I'm releasing this under the MIT license, but you shouldn't publish you're own version.
You're free to modify and publish this as part of a larger extension.

It's outside the scope of the license but I'd love to ask, if you do use this to build
another extension and release that extension, think about open sourcing the extension and
releasing it for free too!
